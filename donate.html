				hiii~ i'm mary, my dearest hobby has been to write random software for fun. you might know me as the
				one who likes dabbling in anything bluesky-related, especially with these notable projects:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<a target="_blank" href="https://skeetdeck.pages.dev">skeetdeck</a>: advanced web client for bluesky
				</li>
				<li>
					<a target="_blank" href="https://mary-ext.github.io/skeetgen">skeetgen</a>: archival tool for your
					bluesky posts
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				projects like skeetdeck will remain free and open source, with no paid features or tracking of any
				kind. However, my time isn't free.
			</p>

			<p>
				i've been laid off from my job since april 2023, and i haven't been able to find another job since, so
				any sort of contribution here would help with my financial burden.
			</p>

			<p>
				i'm eternally grateful to people who chose to support me, even if i'm unable to provide anything
				extra. i can only hope that the time i get to spend working on these projects can benefit everyone,
				<em>including you!</em>
			</p>
